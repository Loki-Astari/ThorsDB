std::exception:         Not throw directly.
                        But all exceptions throw by this library will be derived from this.
std::runtime_error      An unexpected situation.
                        An error occurred that could not be corrected.
                            A read/write failure.
                            An unexpected result from the DB server
                            etc.
std::logic_error        An error because of a bug in user code.
                        The library was called in a way that we can detect is erroneous in
                        the user code. This should be fixed at your end.
std::domain_error       Situations that should never happen.
                        This branch of the code should never be executed. If it does then
                        something else in this library has gone very wrong. This is a serious bug
                        in how the library was written
